# Network Policy Profiles and Overlays

**Status:** Draft  
**Author(s):**  
**Created:**  
**Updated:**  
**Conformance impact:** Informative for core; Normative for network implementors  
**Security/privacy implications:** Network policies govern data transmission rules. Policies MUST not introduce security vulnerabilities or override core authentication requirements.  
**Replaces / Relates to:** Adapted from BECKN-001 (v1.x: Layering Network Policy) and BECKN-004 (v1.x: Policy Administration). Replaces OpenAPI `allOf` overlay mechanism with JSON-LD profiles and DeDi-publishable policy records.

## Abstract

This RFC defines how Beckn v2 networks publish and enforce network-specific policies on top of the core protocol. Networks publish a **Network Profile** document that specifies required schema packs, allowed action subsets, constraint rules, and CDS/CPS configuration. Participants discover and adopt these policies at onboarding and at runtime. This RFC does not modify the core protocol — it defines the layer above it.

---

## 1. Context

Beckn Protocol is domain-agnostic. Networks built on Beckn must add specificity — which sectors they serve, which schema packs are required, what fulfillment types are allowed, what geographic coverage applies. In v1.x, this was done via OpenAPI `allOf` overlays. In v2, it is done via JSON-LD profiles, network policy documents, and DeDi directory records.

---

## 2. Network Policy Layering

```
Core Protocol (this repo)
    └── Domain Specification (sector working group)
            └── Network Profile (network operator)
                    └── Participant Overlay (individual participant extensions)
```

- **Core Protocol**: defines the transport envelope. Immutable for a given version.
- **Domain Specification**: adds sector-specific schema packs and recommended flows.
- **Network Profile**: constrains the domain specification for a specific deployment. May be stricter but MUST NOT contradict core.
- **Participant Overlay**: participant-specific extensions. Must not violate network policy.

## 3. Network Profile Document

A Network Profile is a machine-readable JSON-LD document that defines:

### 3.1 Required Schema Packs

```json
{
  "@type": "NetworkProfile",
  "networkId": "mynetwork.example.org",
  "protocolVersion": "2.0.1",
  "schemaPacks": {
    "required": [
      "https://schema.beckn.io/retail/v1/context.jsonld"
    ],
    "optional": [
      "https://schema.beckn.io/sustainability/v1/context.jsonld"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Supported Actions

Networks MAY restrict which Beckn actions are required or allowed:

```json
{
  "actions": {
    "required": ["discover", "select", "init", "confirm"],
    "optional": ["status", "cancel", "update", "rating"],
    "prohibited": []
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Context Constraints

Networks MAY add constraints to `Context` fields:

```json
{
  "contextConstraints": {
    "domain": {
      "enum": ["beckn:retail", "beckn:grocery"]
    },
    "ttl": {
      "maximum": "PT2M"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.4 Fulfillment Types

```json
{
  "fulfillmentTypes": ["HOME_DELIVERY", "STORE_PICKUP", "DIGITAL_DELIVERY"]
}
```

### 3.5 Geographic Coverage

```json
{
  "spatialCoverage": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [[[72.8, 18.9], [73.0, 18.9], [73.0, 19.1], [72.8, 19.1], [72.8, 18.9]]]
  }
}
```

### 3.6 CPS and CDS Endpoints

```json
{
  "infrastructure": {
    "cps": [
      { "subscriberId": "cps.mynetwork.example.org", "url": "https://cps.mynetwork.example.org" }
    ],
    "cds": [
      { "subscriberId": "cds.mynetwork.example.org", "url": "https://cds.mynetwork.example.org" }
    ],
    "registry": {
      "subscriberId": "registry.mynetwork.example.org",
      "url": "https://registry.mynetwork.example.org"
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Policy Categories

Networks SHOULD categorize policies using these standard categories (adapted from v1.x BECKN-004):

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Implementation | Technical requirements for participant implementations |
| Registration | Requirements for joining the network (KYC, certification, etc.) |
| Subscription | Key rotation schedules, TTL limits, etc. |
| Transaction | Required/optional actions, fulfillment types, schema constraints |
| Payment | Supported payment terms, settlement windows |
| Data Transmission | Mandatory/optional fields, PII handling rules |
| Communication | Timeout rules, retry policies, TTL limits |

---

## 5. Policy Publication and Discovery

Network operators MUST publish their Network Profile:
1. As a publicly accessible JSON-LD document at a stable URL.
2. As a reference in the network's DeDi registry directory entry.

Participants MUST retrieve and validate the Network Profile at onboarding. Participants SHOULD re-validate periodically to detect policy updates.

---

## 6. Policy Enforcement

Participants enforce network policy by:
- Validating incoming `context.domain` against allowed domains.
- Rejecting messages with prohibited actions.
- Validating `message` payloads against required schema packs.
- Applying `contextConstraints` to outgoing requests.

The core transport layer MUST NOT enforce network policies — enforcement is the responsibility of each participant's application middleware.

---

## 7. Constraint Rule

Networks MAY be stricter than the core and domain specifications. Networks MUST NOT:
- Redefine or override core transport schemas.
- Override Beckn Signature requirements.
- Reduce the mandatory `Context` field set.

---

## 8. Conformance Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Level |
|---|---|---|
| CON-019-01 | Network operators MUST publish a Network Profile document | MUST |
| CON-019-02 | Network Profile MUST specify `protocolVersion` | MUST |
| CON-019-03 | Network Profile MUST specify required schema packs | MUST |
| CON-019-04 | Network Profile MUST be accessible at a stable public URL | MUST |
| CON-019-05 | Participants MUST retrieve and apply the Network Profile at onboarding | MUST |
| CON-019-06 | Network policies MUST NOT contradict core transport requirements | MUST |
