# Payments on Beckn-Enabled Networks

**Status:** Draft  
**Author(s):** Ravi Prakash (Beckn Foundation)  
**Created:** 2021-12-10  
**Updated:** 2026-02-01  
**Conformance impact:** Informative for core; normative for network payment policy  
**Security/privacy implications:** Payment endpoints and terms are transmitted in cleartext within signed messages. Sensitive payment credentials MUST NOT be included in Beckn protocol messages.  
**Replaces / Relates to:** Adapted and updated from BECKN-002 (v1.x). Updated for v2 endpoint model and `core_schema` references.

## Abstract

This RFC defines how payment terms are negotiated and communicated between BAPs and BPPs on Beckn-enabled networks. Beckn protocol handles only the **Payment Contract Agreement** — the exchange and agreement of payment terms. Actual payment collection and settlement are performed outside the protocol using existing regional payment infrastructure.

---

## 1. Context

Payments are a highly regulated domain that varies significantly across geo-political regions. Beckn Protocol deliberately does not standardize payment execution — it standardizes only the communication of payment terms between a BAP and a BPP during the transaction lifecycle.

---

## 2. Design Principles

- **Out-of-band payment execution**: The actual movement of money is always performed outside the Beckn protocol using existing payment infrastructure (payment gateways, banking APIs, UPI, SEPA, etc.).
- **In-band payment terms**: The terms of payment (amount, currency, payment endpoint, timing, status) are communicated in-band using Beckn protocol messages.
- **Region-agnostic**: The `Payment` schema uses standard URI schemes (`https://`, `payto://`) to express payment endpoints across payment methods and regions.

## 3. Payment Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Payer** (BAP) | The entity that collects or arranges payment from the buyer |
| **Payee** (BPP) | The entity that receives payment for the fulfilled order |

---

## 4. Payment Contract Agreement

A Payment Contract Agreement between BAP and BPP is reached during the `init` / `on_init` exchange:

1. BAP calls `init` — includes billing details and optionally states that it will collect payment.
2. BPP responds via `on_init` — includes the `Payment` object with its terms.
3. BAP agrees to the terms by proceeding to call `confirm`.

---

## 5. Payment Object

The `Payment` object is defined in `core_schema`. Key fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `url` | Payment endpoint URL. Supported schemes: `https://` (payment gateway), `payto://` (RFC 8905) |
| `params` | Key-value map of payment parameters: `amount`, `currency`, `ifsc`, `vpa`, etc. |
| `type` | Payment timing: `ON-ORDER`, `PRE-FULFILLMENT`, `ON-FULFILLMENT`, `POST-FULFILLMENT` |
| `status` | `NOT-PAID`, `PAID`, `PENDING` |
| `time` | For `POST-FULFILLMENT` — the deadline by which payment must be made |
| `collected_by` | `BAP` or `BPP` — which party collects the payment |

---

## 6. Payment Flows

### Flow 1: BAP Collects Payment

1. BAP informs BPP (via `init`) that it will collect the payment.
2. BPP agrees and sends settlement terms in `on_init`.
3. BAP renders payment interface to buyer; buyer pays BAP.
4. BAP settles with BPP per agreed terms.

### Flow 2: BPP Collects Payment

1. BAP informs BPP (via `init`) that it will NOT collect — BPP should provide payment details.
2. BPP sends payment endpoint and parameters in `on_init`.
3. BAP renders the BPP's payment interface to the buyer.
4. Buyer pays BPP directly.
5. BAP queries BPP for payment status via `status` / `on_status`.

## 7. Payment Object Examples

### Example 1 — BAP Collects, Settles POST-FULFILLMENT via Bank Transfer

```json
{
  "collected_by": "BAP",
  "url": "payto://bank/98273982749428?amount=$currency:$value&ifsc=$ifsc",
  "tl_method": "PAYTO",
  "type": "POST-FULFILLMENT",
  "status": "NOT-PAID",
  "params": {
    "ifsc": "SBIN0000575",
    "value": "200",
    "currency": "INR"
  },
  "time": {
    "range": { "end": "2026-11-30T00:00:00Z" }
  }
}
```

### Example 2 — BPP Collects via UPI, ON-ORDER

```json
{
  "url": "payto://upi/example@upi?amount=$currency:$value",
  "tl_method": "PAYTO",
  "type": "ON-ORDER",
  "status": "NOT-PAID",
  "params": {
    "value": "200",
    "currency": "INR"
  }
}
```

### Example 3 — BPP Collects via Payment Gateway

```json
{
  "url": "https://pay.example.com?amount=$value&cur=$currency",
  "tl_method": "HTTP/POST",
  "type": "ON-ORDER",
  "status": "NOT-PAID",
  "params": {
    "value": "200",
    "currency": "INR"
  }
}
```
