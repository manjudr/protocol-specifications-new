# Network Architecture

**Status:** Informative  
**Applies to:** Beckn Protocol v2.0.x (current LTS: v2.0.1)

---

## 1. Overview

A Beckn v2 network is a set of independently operated platforms that communicate with each other using the Beckn Protocol transport envelope. Each platform implements a specific **actor role**. The network has no central broker: all communication is peer-to-peer, mediated only by a shared registry for identity and key resolution.

---

## 2. Actor Roles

### 2.1 Beckn Application Platform (BAP)

A BAP is a buyer-side platform. It represents the consumer's interface to the network. A BAP:

- Sends `RequestContainer` messages to CDS (for discovery) and BPPs (for transactions).
- Implements a callback endpoint to receive `CallbackContainer` responses.
- Resolves BPP endpoints and signing keys via the DeDi-compliant Registry.

Examples: consumer apps, aggregator platforms, agent interfaces, IoT clients.

### 2.2 Beckn Provider Platform (BPP)

A BPP is a seller-side platform. It represents a provider's catalog, transaction engine, and fulfillment logic. A BPP:

- Publishes catalog updates to the CPS.
- Receives `RequestContainer` messages from BAPs and responds via `CallbackContainer` callbacks.
- Registers itself in the DeDi-compliant Registry with its endpoint, signing keys, and capabilities.

Examples: e-commerce backends, mobility providers, logistics platforms, healthcare providers.

### 2.3 Catalog Publishing Service (CPS)

A CPS is the catalog ingestion layer. It:

- Accepts asynchronous catalog push publications from BPPs (as `RequestContainer` messages on the `publish` endpoint).
- Normalizes catalog data against the Beckn v2 `core_schema` and domain schema packs.
- Forwards indexed catalog graphs to one or more CDS instances.

A network may operate multiple CPS instances. A BPP may publish to more than one CPS.

### 2.4 Catalog Discovery Service (CDS)

A CDS is the discovery query engine. It:

- Maintains a continuously updated index of `Catalog` / `Item` / `Offer` graphs received from CPS.
- Answers discovery queries from BAPs (on the `discover` endpoint), returning matching catalog subsets.
- Does **not** multicast to BPPs; all discovery is served from its own index.

### 2.5 DeDi-Compliant Registry

The Registry is the identity and trust anchor of the network. It:

- Stores participant records (BAP, BPP, CPS, CDS) as [DeDi](https://dedi.global)-compliant directory entries.
- Exposes DeDi-standard APIs for participant registration (`subscribe`), key publication, and lookup (`lookup`).
- Allows any participant to resolve a `subscriberId` to its public signing key, endpoint URL, and capabilities.

In v1.x this was a bespoke Beckn registry. In v2 it is a DeDi-compliant public directory.

## 3. Core → Domain → Network Layering

Beckn v2 adopts an explicit three-layer governance and schema model:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Network Layer                                          │
│  Network-specific constraints, regional policies,       │
│  mandatory schema pack lists, CDS configuration         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Domain Layer                                           │
│  Domain schema packs, domain IGs, sector-specific       │
│  vocabulary bindings and conformance guidance           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Core Layer                                             │
│  Transport envelope (this repo), core_schema,           │
│  DeDi registry contract, CPS/CDS interface contracts    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key constraint:** Higher layers may be _stricter_ than lower layers. They MUST NOT contradict or redefine core semantics.

## 4. Component Interaction Model

### 4.1 Catalog Publication Flow (BPP → CPS → CDS)

```
BPP ──publish(catalog)──► CPS ──normalize & index──► CDS
```

1. BPP sends a `RequestContainer` with a `publish` action to CPS.
2. CPS normalizes the payload against `core_schema` and domain schema packs.
3. CPS forwards `Item` / `Offer` / `Provider` graphs to CDS for indexing.
4. This flow runs continuously and is decoupled from any BAP request.

### 4.2 Discovery Flow (BAP → CDS)

```
BAP ──discover(query)──► CDS ──catalog subset──► BAP
```

1. BAP sends a `RequestContainer` with a `discover` action to CDS.
2. CDS resolves, scores, and returns matching catalog data.
3. BAP receives results as a `CallbackContainer` (or synchronously, depending on network policy).

### 4.3 Transaction Flow (BAP → BPP)

```
BAP ──select/init/confirm/...──► BPP ──on_select/on_init/on_confirm/...──► BAP
```

Post-discovery, BAP communicates directly with BPP for all transactional actions (`select`, `init`, `confirm`, `status`, `cancel`, `update`, `rating`).

### 4.4 Registry Lookup Flow

```
BAP / BPP ──lookup(subscriberId)──► DeDi Registry ──{endpoint, publicKey}──► caller
```

Before sending a request, a participant resolves the recipient's endpoint and public key from the registry. Before accepting a request, a participant resolves the sender's public key to verify the Beckn Signature.

## 6. Comparison with v1.x Architecture

| Aspect | v1.x | v2.0.x |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery | BG multicast `search` to all BPPs | BAP queries CDS index |
| Catalog updates | Pull on demand (search triggers BPP response) | BPP pushes asynchronously to CPS |
| Registry | Bespoke Beckn `lookup`/`subscribe` | DeDi-compliant public directory |
| Schema | OpenAPI/JSON Schema, ad-hoc fields | JSON-LD + schema.org, typed graphs |
| Endpoint model | Per-action endpoints (`/search`, `/confirm`, etc.) | Universal `/beckn/{becknEndpoint}` |
